# TENSE
Tutorial code for the paper "Bayesian Emulation for Computer Models with Multiple Partial Discontinuities". A simple demonstration of the Torn Embedding Non-Stationary Emulation (TENSE) approach for emulating in the presense of discontinuities.

Execute the code in "TENSE Emulating functions with multiple discontinuities.R" to reproduce the figures from sections 2 and 3 of the paper.
